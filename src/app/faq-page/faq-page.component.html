  <p>The ceremony will start at 5pm with food to follow right after. Feel free to show up earlier if you'd like to swim,
    drink, and hangout.</p>

  <h2 id="parking-situation">Where should I park?</h2>

  <p>
    If you plan on driving, you will be able to park directly on the property. Tina's parents will have a makeshift
    parking lot for people's vehicles.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you plan on staying at one of the hotels listed in the <a routerLink="/lodging">lodging section</a>, we will be
    working to coordinate a
    shuttle service to-and-from the property. That way you can drink and not have to worry about designated drivers.
  </p>

  <h2 id="flight-plan">I'm coming from out of state. How should I get there?</h2>

  <p>
    If you must fly, I'd recommend landing in Madison (MSN), renting a car, then driving to Mauston (a 1-hour trip).
  </p>

  <p>
    Alternatively, if you choose to make an awesome road trip to Wisconsin, you should <a routerLink="/photos">share
      pictures</a> of your
    journey with everyone!
  </p>

  <h2>What will be served for dinner?</h2>

  <p>We will be catering a buffet that will include a smoked brisket, roast turkey, vegetarian lasagna, mashed potatoes,
    corn, green beans, and a salad. If you have special dietary restrictions we will not be offended if you bring your
    own snacks/meal.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-the-dress-code">What is the dress code?</h2>

  <p><strong>Extremely</strong> casual. This will be an <em>outdoor summertime</em> wedding in rural Wisconsin,
    so dress to beat the heat. Donâ€™t be the guy who shows up in a fancy suit, we might be forced to throw you in the
    lake. Which reminds me: donâ€™t forget to bring a swimsuit! ðŸ‘™ </p>

  <h2 id="is-there-a-gift-registry">Is there a gift registry?</h2>

  <p><strong>No gifts please.</strong> We already have a home/kitchen filled with everything we need ðŸ˜ƒ. We realize this
    wedding is likely to incur many travel expenses, so we donâ€™t want to shake down our friends and family for cast iron
    pans etc. If you insist on flexing your wealth, feel free to <a href="https://gofund.me/cd2cff93"
      target="_blank">donate to our
      honeymoon gofundme</a>. However that is completely optional; celebrating with you and your loved ones will be gift
    enough.</p>

  <h2 id="can-i-bring-my-dogschildren">Can I bring my dogs/children?</h2>

  <p>Yes! However, children must remain on a leash at all times. ðŸ˜œ</p>
